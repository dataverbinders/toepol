We intend to use [DbSchema](https://dbschema.com/) to:
- author and maintain the logical datamodel (independent of chosen storage engine)
- generate SQL DDL for various storage engines, including Bigquery and Azure datalake

Note that the SQL code generation in DbSchema can be customized with templates. They are also willing to help out if we run into issues.
